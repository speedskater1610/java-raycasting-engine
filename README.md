java raycasting engine

basically turns my [C raycasting engine](https://github.com/speedskater1610/rawcasting-engine-in-C) into java. purely did this to help me understand java better before having to learn it next year for school   


## heres all the stuff I should put blah blah blah blah...
you can clone it with `git clone https://github.com/speedskater1610/java-raycasting-engine`   
compile with `javac main.java` and run with `java main`    
or you can just run the already compiled version with `java ray.class`

## I forget what I put the license as but feel free to copy and add to my code or what ever
